hello
this repo contains a visual of conway's game of life that runs in the terminal. It'll stop once the board state stops changing.

recommendations:
- if the board state begins to cycle, use CTRL+C
- fullscreen in default terminal: length 22, width 40
- fullscreen in fullscreen terminal: length 62, width 102 (at least for my macbook)

instructions:
1. clone this repo
2. run in its directory:
  $ ./C
3. enter board size
4. watch game of life
